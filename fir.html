    <p><h2><u>Internet</u></h2></p>
    <p><h3>Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized mass communication, mass media, and commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. Sometimes referred to as a “network of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States in the 1970s but did not become visible to the general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet. And that number is growing, largely due to the prevalence of “smart” technology and the "Internet of Things," where computer-like devices connect with the Internet or interact via wireless networks. These “things” include smartphones, appliances, thermostats, lighting systems, irrigation systems, security cameras. vehicles, even cities.

    <p><h3>The Internet is a global network connecting billions of devices, enabling communication and information sharing. It functions through interconnected networks using standardized protocols, like TCP/IP, to transmit data between devices and servers. This allows users to access a vast array of services, including websites, email, social media, and online applications. </h3></p>
    <p><h3>Internet applications are software programs that utilize the internet for various functions, including communication, information access, entertainment, and business transactions. They range from simple email clients to complex e-commerce platforms and social media networks. These applications rely on web browsers and other client software to interact with remote servers over the internet.
